# Web Unblocker V1
This is an unblocker that lets you access the web freely without restrictions, with exceptions.
V1 Uses LTBEEF, but may still let admins see your history, even if filters and checkers are removed.
Please Fork this Repository for your local school, edit the code, then share with your friends.
LTBEEF Uses an exploit in extension Code to allow disabling of extensions at the code level.
This may not work on some devices, where Inspect Element is disabled.
